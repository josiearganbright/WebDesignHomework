            <p>I have always been drawn to the human experience, to the small moments that aren’t normally seen. I want to capture the mundane and intimate moments experienced in everyday life and shine a spotlight on them to visualize the feelings our shared human experience. My work dramatizes snapshots of private moments that are not usually considered significant or important.
            </p>
            <p>Paint is the main medium that I prefer. Painting allows me to layer color to build depth, control expressive lighting, and add metaphorical elements—all of which help evoke emotions I wish to convey. The rich history behind paint is inspiring and looking at other painters throughout history has had a huge impact on my work; the idea of working with light was strongly inspired by Edward Hopper and I look at Francis Bacon's work whenever I want to experiment with brushwork. I have spent hours developing my own style and experimenting with how different variations of brush strokes and colors can be used in a piece and what kind of visual and emotional effect they have. 
            </p>
            <p>I have made it a long way in my art journey, but I have a long way to go. I have just started to work on progressively larger surfaces, which is what I feel is best for my style and the impact of the piece, but which also pose specific challenges that I am learning how to solve. In the past year, I have started to really develop a strong sense of style. While it is getting better with everything I paint, I can see elements I want to expand, strengthen, or leave behind.
