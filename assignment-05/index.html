        The painting "Diego and I" (1949) depicts a self-portrait of the teary-eyed Frida Kahlo with her husband Diego on her forehead.
         This is quite obviously something to do with their relationship, which,
         researching more about, was extremely toxic with multiple affairs on both sides which led to them getting divorced and married to each other again
    </p>

        Kahlo is communicating how she feels stuck to Diego and a lesser being than him. She doesn't enjoy being in this relationship,
         but there is no way out even if she tried because she is that mentally trapped to him. 
         They aren't paying attention to each other at all, but they are still connected to each other.
          It's hard to say whether Kahlo hopes to get out of this relationship or for it to become less toxic, maybe both, 
          but it's safe to assume that she wants something about it to change for the better.

        Lots of Kahlo's self-portraits don't show her having a lot of emotion on her face, including this one. 
        The tears on her face are a telltale sign that she is not happy. The way that the portrait of Diego is on her forehead
         while he has a third eye on his forehead implies that, while he is enlightened because of his third eye, all that she is able to see is him.
          It seems as though she sees herself as less than him because of her lack of a third eye. Kahlo is communicating directly with the viewer
           and making eye contact, while Diego is looking off into the distance. This feels like a rebellion on Kahlo's part
            like she is not supposed to be looking at us and is instead supposed to be following Diego's gaze because her head 
            is turned in the same direction he is looking. The light and color choice seems to be very true to real life, with nothing 
            really standing out as a specifically chosen color. The only colors that could be manipulated in this are the red of Diego's shirt 
            and the green background, but they seem to be very insignificant in terms of analyzing the piece. The natural light quality/short
             shadow depth makes this seem very real and unexaggerated. This is just what Kahlo feels every day, nothing unrealistic added.
