            The story of Judith slaying Holofernes is a genre of painting similar to Mary holding baby Jesus, it has been painted countless times by countless different artists. The difference between Mary and Jesus paintings and Judith and Holofernes paintings (despite the obvious difference in themes) is how much variance Judith and Holofernes go through, specifically Judith. While Mary stays relatively the same character throughout history, Judith's entire persona completely changes depending on the artist. She has been insulted and belittled by the art world weakening her, sexualizing her, and daintifying her. Still, Artemisia Gentileschi represented Judith as a strong character, becoming one of the most famous depictions of this scene and saving Judith's legacy, and ensuring Gentileschi’s future legacy.

            In perhaps the most famous painting of this scene after Gentileschi’s depiction, Caravaggio shows Judith as weak. She is a young girl with a frilly dress and a concerned expression. She looks scared and is stepped back very far from Holofernes, indicating that she is hesitant. One of the most interesting parts of this piece and Caravaggio is that he was Gentileschi's mentor. Both of their depictions show incredible skill and knowledge with the medium and light, adding an amazing source of drama to the pieces. The subject matter, however, is wildly different. These paintings are the most interesting to compare because there are so many similarities between the poses as well as the style that the differences that are there are amplified. Both Judiths are holding Holofernes' hair with their left hand and cutting his neck with their right. Their arms are straight with their elbows locked as Holofernes struggles under the sheets. Despite the face value similarities, the difference between Judiths is so clear. Gentileschi’s Judith is not scared, she is not the least bit doubtful about her abilities and if her actions are right or wrong. While Caravaggio’s Judith holds Holoferne's hair to steady her, Gentileschi’s holds his hair with purpose, pushing his head to the table to hold him steady, showing that she is not hesitant at all and is sure of her purpose there.

            Franz Stuck painted his version of Judith in 1928, portraying her as a great seductress, clothed only by a helmet and her sword after she fatally seduced Holofernes into letting her into his room. She has a look of pride and heartlessness as she stands and looks at her victim's body with her hip cocked out to the side in a classic, femme-fatal stance. The difference between Stuck’s version and Gentileschi’s version is extremely easy to see. Not only are the styles polar opposites, but Judith's story is also completely different in both of them. In Stuck’s version, Judith seems to be a murderous temptress, a wildly gorgeous woman who kills men after sleeping with them for no other reason other than her own enjoyment. In Gentileschi’s version, it is much easier to see the character of the original story. She is not murderous, nor a temptress, she is someone who stepped up to kill the general of a cruel king. She is not enjoying the murder, as seen by her slight grimace, but she knows that it is what she must do.

            Giorgione's depiction of Judith is very casual and dainty. She is stepping on Holofernes’ decapitated head, but not in a taunting way. To the viewer, it almost looks like she just happened to stumble upon his head, which has no more of an impact on her than a weed in her flowerbed would. She looks at him with a beautiful, dainty expression on her face. We do not see the aftermath of the day after Holofernes’ murder from Gentileschi, however, it is easy to see that the Judith we see in her version would certainly not be looking gracefully at the head she brutally cut through. It is much more likely that if she happened to see the head, she would be wearing the same concerned expression that she had at the moment of the killing. No worry lines have ever touched the skin of the Judith in Giorgione’s depiction. It is unimaginable that she could ever harm a fly, let alone brutally murder a man.

            With so many weakened, sexualized, and daintified versions of Judith, Gentileschi’s painting of Judith beheading Holofernes is so important to show a realistic and true to the story portrayal of Judith.
